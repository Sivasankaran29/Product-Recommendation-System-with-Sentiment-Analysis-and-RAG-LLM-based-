"Apple iPhone 14 (Blue, 128 GB)",5.0,Without doubt my first iphone proved that it is far better than Android phones. Battery may not work more than 15 hours if you have lot of calls and activities. 14 and 14 plus both are excellent since my colleague purchased 14 plus since he need bigger display. You can go for any 14 series according to your requirements.,0.39166666666666666,POSITIVE,user_233,1480,1

4. Have a concern on Battery , though drains on a single day usage - It doesnt means a negative feedback since its 20W Charger charged from 3 to 60 at a time of 10 minutes. I was too surprised- The best class in Apple Series.

A non Chinese phone, and made in india. Good design, unique OS, no heating issue, battery lasts for an entire day. Gylphs are eye catcher, but of no practical use. Very different look compared to all other android phones.
Smooth phone.
