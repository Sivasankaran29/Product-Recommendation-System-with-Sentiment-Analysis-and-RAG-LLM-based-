iPhone heats a lot because of its built. Its frame is steel and the back is glass but it has great things when it gets hot, it restricts some features to cool it down.

The camera is good, sometimes it misses focus.

Performance is the best part of it."

The phone is super thin and light. Charging and battery backup is great. The camera is possibly the best in this price segment. Speaker output is reasonable. Overall I would give 10 stars to this product. It is better looking and performing than the GT6."

the battery of f5 would last 7.5 hours f6 would last 5.5 hrs.

The camera of f6 is better than f5

Naked phone, the back is slippery

The case is a grey matt case ( no longer transparent case) in the box.

No issues on performance.

"POCO F6 5G (Black, 256 GB)  (12 GB RAM)",5.0,Sold my iPhone 14 plus for F6(12-512). A clear upgrade in terms of glitch free experience. I use my phone without a back cover and this phone is very easy to use one-handed. 14 plus had better battery but couldn't use it properly with one hand. I think the tradeoff is worth it since the F6 battery is sufficient for a full day. I'm officially a fanboy for the F series since I used to have a Poco F1 which is still functioning okay in 2024.

Pros:

"Apple iPhone 15 (Green, 128 GB)",5.0,"I appreciate that the iPhone 15 has turned its weakest aspect, the dynamic range, into one of its strongest features. However, the 60 Hz display bothers me daily. It's not that a 60 Hz display is inherently bad, but after spending so much on a phone in 2024, not getting a smooth display experience is disappointing. This makes it the most expensive phone with a 60 Hz display. Apart from that, everything else is superb."

"Apple iPhone 15 (Green, 128 GB)",5.0,"Guys dont listen to negative reviews about 60hz display and batter heating issues. ios makes you forget that you are using a 60hz display cuz its much better than a 90hz or 120hz display in android. zero bugs, amazing user interface, best camera in class. after using oneplus, samsung, redmi, realme, infinix and oppo for the past 10 years, finally am realising why people hype iphones. truly amazing experience."

I would definitely recommend it. Just go for it you wont regret."

"Apple iPhone 15 (Green, 128 GB)",5.0,Very Best baseline iPhone ever. even if you have a iphone 14 it is still a upgrade. the new frosted glass and rounded edges make it premium feel. camera is just awesome. better than 14 pro camera. battery is just like iphone 14. type c is also a welcome with braided data cabel. just blue colour looks a lot like white.

"Apple iPhone 15 (Green, 128 GB)",4.0,Not justifying the price .. bit disappointed about the display (refresh rate should be high).. no differences between 12 and 15 except brightness .. those who willing to upgrade plz be ok with your 13 .. there is very low difference in day to day life use..but the Dynamic Island is awesome it is way better than expected..

"Apple iPhone 15 (Green, 128 GB)",4.0,"Good phone. But some times keep thinking why we purchase the same phones rebranded with higher number (iPhone 13, 14, 15 etc.) from Apple every year. Not great updates compared to previous gen phones. Worth purchasing only if you are using very old phone (at least 3 years old) and wait for deals. Been using this one for few months now. No issues and no glitches."
